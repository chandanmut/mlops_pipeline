Full-stack data science + MLOps project
<<<<<<< HEAD
Implement an end-to-end ML workflow with GitHub Actions and Airflow. The feature pipeline fetches data from S3, processes it, and saves gold data to the warehouse. 
A training pipeline leverages MLflow for logging, tracking, and model management. 
GitHub Actions automate workflows for PRs and merges. Documentation is included for PR/merge strategy.
